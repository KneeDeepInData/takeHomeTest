# SampleExercise

## Exercise

We'll get started by importing the library we'll use to create a simple command-line interface and the libraries we'll use to do our object detection.

 

`argparse` will make it possible to create a simple command-line interface. `numpy` will provide `array` methods we'll need.  `cv2` will provide the deep learning framework.

## Instructions

- Import `numpy` into your environment with the alias `np`.
- Import `argparse` into your environment.
- Finally, import the `cv2` library into your environment.

```python
# import the packages
import argparse
import numpy as np
import cv2
```
