# TrackProposal

## Track Name: **Deep Learning with Video in Python**

**Track Description**

From accurately identifying moving obstacles in self-driving car feeds to distinguishing the subtle giveaways of deepfakes, the ability to process and analyze video helps us gain vital situational context that we can't achieve through static image analysis. In this track, you'll take your first steps toward gaining broader situational context from video by learning how to use deep learning models to detect faces and objects in video. You'll then dive deep into convolutional neural networks and use them to classify the broader context of video through rolling averaging.  

## High-Level Track Learning Outcomes

*After completion of this track, the learner will be able to:*

- Develop a script that performs object detection on a video.
- Summarize how a convolutional neural network works and how it classifies a video.
- Develop a script that can classify the broader context of a video.
